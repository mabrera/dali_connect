# Dali Connect

Dali Connect is a social media platform that allows you to stay in touch with your Dali peers. Feel free to browse the Directory of Dali members to see what they've been up to. You can also create a new user for yourself, make and like posts, and follow other users. Have fun!

You can see the site live at http://54.186.222.133/

This project constitutes my submission for the Dali Lab Social Media Frontend Developer Challenge
