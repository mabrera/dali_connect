# Dali Connect

Dali Connect is a social media platform that allows you to stay in touch with your Dali peers. Feel free to browse the Directory of Dali members to see what they've been up to. You can also create a new user for yourself, make and like posts, and follow other users. I'd definitely recommend this if you have time, so you can check out all the features and design choices visible only to logged in users; if you're short on time, the passwords to all existing users are literally 'p'. Have fun!

You can see the site live at http://54.186.222.133/
